# How to Play the Game
If you just want to play the latest version of the game you can get it from our [website](https://cortex-command-community.github.io), and you can get mods from our [mod portal](https://cccp.mod.io).

# Windows Build Instructions
First you need to download the necessary files:

1. Install the necessary tools.  
You'll probably want [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (build supports both 2017 and 2019 versions).  
You also need to have both x86 and x64 versions of the [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) installed in order to run the compiled builds.  
You may also want to check out the list of recommended Visual Studio plugins [here](https://github.com/cortex-command-community/Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source/wiki/Information,-Recommended-Plugins-and-Useful-Links).

2. Clone this Source Repository and the [Data Repository](https://github.com/cortex-command-community/Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Data) in neighboring folders.  
**Do Not** change the folder names unless you want to make trouble for yourself.

3. Copy the following libraries from `Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source\external\lib\` into the **Data Repository**:
* `lua51.dll`
* `lua51-64.dll`
* `fmod.dll`
* `fmodL.dll`

Now you're ready to build and launch the game.  
Simply open `RTEA.sln` with Visual Studio, choose your target platform (x86 or x64) and configuration, and run the project.

* Use `Debug Full` for debugging with all visual elements enabled (builds fast, runs very slow).
* Use `Debug Minimal` for debugging with all visual elements disabled (builds fast, runs slightly faster).
* Use `Debug Release` for a debugger-enabled release build (builds slow, runs almost as fast as Final).
* Use `Final` to build release executable.

The first build will take a while, but future ones should be quicker.

If you want to use an IDE other than Visual Studio, you will have to build using meson. Check the [Linux](#building) and [Installing Dependencies](#installing-dependencies) section for pointers.

***

# Linux Build Instructions
The Linux build uses the meson build system, and builds against system libraries.

## Dependencies

* `g++>=8.1` (needs to support c++17 filesystem)
* `allegro4`
* `loadpng`
* `flac`
* `luajit`
* `minizip`
* `libpng`
* `libX11`
* [`meson`](https://www.mesonbuild.com)`>= 0.53` (If your distro doesn't have a recent version of meson, use the pip version instead)
* `boost>=1.55`

## Building

1. Install Dependencies (see [below](#installing-dependencies) for some distro-specific instructions).

2. Clone this Source Repository and the [Data Respository](https://github.com/cortex-command-community/Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Data).

3. Open a terminal in the Source Repository.

4. `meson build` or `meson --buildtype=debug build` for debug build (default is release build)

5. `ninja -C build`

6. (optional) `sudo ninja install -C build` (To uninstall later, keep the build directory intact. The game can then be uninstalled by `sudo ninja uninstall -C build`)

If you want to change the buildtype afterwards, you can use `meson configure --buildtype {release or debug}` in the build directory or create a secondary build directory as in Step 4. There are also additional build options documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/cortex-command-community/Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source/wiki/Meson-build-options) as well as through running `meson configure` in the build directory.

## Running
(If you installed the game in step 6 above, it should appear with your regular applications and will just run)

1. Copy (or link, might be preferable for testing builds) `build/CortexCommand.x86_64` or `build/CortexCommand_debug.x86_64` (depending on if you made a debug build) into the **Data Repository**.

   `cd $DATA_REPOSITORY; ln -s ../Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source/build/CortexCommand.x86_64 . `

2. Copy all `libfmod` files from `external/lib/linux/x86_64` into the **Data Repository**.

   `cd $DATA_REPOSITORY; ln -s ../Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source/external/lib/linux/x86_64/libfmod.so* .`

4. Run `./CortexCommand.x86_64` or `./CortexCommand_debug.x86_64` in the **Data Repository**.

## Installing Dependencies

**Arch Linux:**  
`# pacman -S allegro4 boost flac luajit minizip libpng libx11 meson ninja base-devel`

**Ubuntu >=20.04:**  
`# apt-get install build-essential libboost-dev liballegro4-dev libloadpng4-dev libflac++-dev luajit-5.1-dev libminizip-dev libpng++-dev libx11-dev ninja-build meson`  
## Troubleshooting

On some distros some keyboards and mice are recognized as controllers, to fix this follow these instructions: [https://github.com/denilsonsa/udev-joystick-blacklist](https://github.com/denilsonsa/udev-joystick-blacklist)

***

**Windows 10 (64-bit) without Visual Studio**  
- [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)
- [Clang Toolset](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) (Grab the latest LLVM-...-win64.exe)
- [git](https://www.git-scm.org)
- [meson](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/releases) (documentation [here](https://www.mesonbuild.com))
- (optional) Visual Studio for the Developer Consoles since setup otherwise may be unnecessarily hard
